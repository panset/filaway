## ADR-001 — Build with pure SwiftPM, no Xcode project

**Date:** 2026-08-22 · **Task:** M1-01 · **Status:** accepted (revisit when Xcode is installed)

**Context.** The plan (§1) assumed Xcode 16.4+ with an XcodeGen-generated
`.xcodeproj` for the app target. At kickoff the dev machine turned out to have
only the Command Line Tools (Swift 6.0.3, macOS 26.1) and no Xcode.app, so
`xcodebuild`, XcodeGen's output, and XCTest UI tests are all unusable.

**Decision.** A single root `Package.swift` (swift-tools-version 6.0) defines
every target: `FilawayCore` (library), `FilawayApp` (executable, SwiftUI +
AppKit), `filaway-bench` (executable) and `FilawayCoreTests`. Language modes
follow plan §1: Swift 6 in Core, Swift 5 + `StrictConcurrency` upcoming-feature
warnings in the app target for AppKit interop. Min platform macOS 14.

**Consequences.**
- `swift build` / `swift test` are the whole build; CI runs the same commands.
- Universal (arm64 + x86_64) builds are **not possible**: `--arch arm64 --arch
  x86_64` requires Xcode's `xcbuild`, which the CLT does not ship. Builds are
  native arm64; `Tools/make_app.sh` warns. Intel support must be re-verified
  once Xcode exists.
- XCTest UI tests are replaced by Core-level tests plus a `FILAWAY_SMOKE=1`
  launch hook in `AppDelegate` that prints window title/size and exits.
- `project.yml` becomes additive later; `Package.swift` stays the source of truth.

## ADR-002 — The `.app` bundle is assembled by a script and ad-hoc signed

**Date:** 2026-08-22 · **Task:** M1-01 / M1-02 · **Status:** accepted (signing steps blocked)

**Context.** SwiftPM produces a bare executable, not a bundle. A SwiftUI app run
as a bare executable launches as an accessory: no menu bar, no key window. There
are also no code-signing identities on the machine and no Developer Program
enrolment, so the M1-02 notarization dry run cannot complete.

**Decision.** `Tools/make_app.sh` assembles `build/Filaway.app` by hand —
`Contents/Info.plist` (id `com.tejaspanse.filaway`, `NSPrincipalClass`
`NSApplication`, `LSMinimumSystemVersion` 14.0, `NSHighResolutionCapable`),
`Contents/MacOS/Filaway`, and any SwiftPM `*.bundle` resources copied into
`Contents/Resources/` so `Bundle.module` resolves — then ad-hoc signs it
(`codesign --force --deep --sign -`). `AppDelegate` additionally forces
`.regular` activation policy and calls `activate`, so the app also behaves when
run directly via `swift run`. `Tools/make_dmg.sh` prefers `create-dmg` and falls
back to `hdiutil`. `Tools/notarize.sh` checks every precondition (notarytool,
stapler, a Developer ID identity, the `filaway-notary` keychain profile) and
exits with an explicit `BLOCKED: …` message rather than failing obscurely.

**Consequences.**
- `make app`, `make run` and `make dmg` work today; `make notarize` reports
  `BLOCKED: no 'Developer ID Application' certificate in the keychain.`
- `create-dmg`'s AppleScript window layout needs an unlocked GUI session; the
  `hdiutil` fallback covers headless/locked and CI runs.
- Risk #5 (signing/notarization friction) stays open until the user enrols and
  installs Xcode. `notarize.sh` is written end-to-end so it can be verified in
  one pass at that point.

## ADR-003 — Initial dependency set and version pins

**Date:** 2026-08-22 · **Task:** M1-01 · **Status:** accepted

**Context.** Plan §1 names GRDB (derived DB), swift-markdown (parsing) and
Sparkle (updates); the bench CLI needs argument parsing. The 6.0.3 toolchain
cannot read packages that declare swift-tools-version 6.1.

**Decision.** Three direct dependencies, resolved as:

| Package | Constraint | Resolved |
|---|---|---|
| `groue/GRDB.swift` | `"7.0.0" ..< "7.9.0"` | **7.8.0** |
| `swiftlang/swift-markdown` | `from: "0.8.0"` | **0.8.0** (pulls swift-cmark 0.8.0) |
| `apple/swift-argument-parser` | `from: "1.8.0"` | **1.8.2** |

Sparkle is deliberately **not** added yet: it is M4-04, and its EdDSA signing is
blocked on the same missing credentials.

**Consequences.**
- The GRDB upper bound is a toolchain workaround, not a compatibility judgement:
  7.9.0+ declares swift-tools-version 6.1 and fails to resolve here with
  `contains incompatible tools version (6.1.0)`. Raise the bound once Swift 6.1+
  is available.
- `Package.resolved` is committed, so CI and the dev machine resolve identically.
- Tests use **Swift Testing** (`import Testing`), which the 6.0.3 toolchain
  supports natively via SwiftPM — no XCTest and no extra dependency needed.

## ADR-004 — The editor runs on TextKit 2

**Date:** 2026-08-22 · **Task:** M1-10 · **Status:** accepted

**Context.** Plan §1 picks `NSTextView` (TextKit 2) for the styled-Markdown-source
editor and plan §5 lists it as risk #1, with "fall back to TextKit 1 if TK2
fragments misbehave". The two things TK2 was suspected of making hard are the
fenced-code background and the hover `Copy` overlay.

**Decision.** TextKit 2 (`NSTextView(usingTextLayoutManager: true)`), **no**
custom `NSTextStorage` subclass and **no** custom `NSTextLayoutFragment`
subclass. Instead:

- Attributes are applied from `NSTextStorageDelegate`'s
  `textStorage(_:didProcessEditing:range:changeInLength:)` over the range the
  highlighter reports as invalidated (re-entrancy guarded by a flag). TK2 keeps
  an `NSTextStorage` behind `NSTextContentStorage`, so this classic path works
  unchanged and no storage subclass is needed.
- The code-block background is drawn in `NSTextView.drawBackground(in:)` as a
  rounded rect, sized from the union of `NSTextLayoutFragment.layoutFragmentFrame`
  for the block's range (`enumerateTextLayoutFragments`), widened to the text
  container. A layout-fragment subclass would tie the drawing to element
  boundaries; drawing from the frames keeps the block a single rounded rect
  even when one block spans several fragments.
- The language tag and hover `Copy` button are ordinary `NSView`s added as
  subviews of the text view (so they scroll with the text), pooled and
  repositioned on layout, scroll, and text change. Hover is tracked with one
  `NSTrackingArea` on the text view and hit-tested against the cached block
  rects, so no per-block tracking areas.
- Only blocks overlapping the TK2 viewport range (± 4 000 characters) get a
  rect computed — computing one forces layout, so touching every block would
  make a large note O(document) per relayout.

The TextKit 1 branch survives in one place (`blockRect(for:)` falls back to
`NSLayoutManager.boundingRect(forGlyphRange:in:)`), so a downgrade is a
one-line change to the initializer, not a rewrite.

**Consequences.**
- No TK2 problems were hit: fragment frames, viewport range and
  `characterIndexForInsertion(at:)` all behave. Risk #1's "TK2 fragments
  misbehave" branch is closed.
- Measured on this machine (`FILAWAY_SMOKE=1`, release build, 50 KB note with
  723 code blocks): highlight + attribute application **0.004 ms per
  keystroke**; whole `insertText` round trip 3.1 ms mean / 3.2 ms p95 (the rest
  is AppKit's own undo + layout invalidation); decoration pass 0.68 ms
  steady-state, coalesced to at most once per run-loop turn.
- Attribute application happens inside `didProcessEditing`, so an edit that
  arrives while attributes are being applied is ignored by design (attributes
  never change characters).
- A programmatic whole-document swap (`setMarkdown`) skips the incremental path
  and re-parses once, because `isRichText = false` re-applies typing attributes
  over the whole string after `string = …`.

## ADR-005 — Styling is spans over the source, never a transformed document

**Date:** 2026-08-22 · **Task:** M1-10 · **Status:** accepted

**Context.** FR-2.1 leaves "renders Markdown live or shows styled text" to the
design spec; plan §1 commits to WYSIWYM — the text storage *is* the file bytes.
The temptation in every Markdown editor is to hide syntax marks or replace
`- [ ]` with a checkbox glyph.

**Decision.** `MarkdownHighlighter` (in `FilawayCore`, no AppKit) returns
**UTF-16 style spans**; the editor only ever adds attributes. Nothing is
inserted, removed, substituted or attachment-ised. Syntax marks (`#`, `**`,
backticks, fences, `[`, `](`) are dimmed to `tertiaryLabelColor`, never hidden;
clicking a checkbox rewrites the three source characters `[ ]` ↔ `[x]` through
the normal undoable edit path.

The highlighter mirrors the document as a `[UInt16]` array plus a line index
carrying the fenced-code state at each line start. An edit re-tokenizes only
the touched lines; when the fence state at the end of those lines changes it
keeps going forward until the state re-converges (the only O(document) case,
measured at 0.2 ms on 1 MB in release).

**Consequences.**
- DS-1 is trivially true: what is saved is what was typed. External edits and
  AI-applied merges reconcile as plain text.
- Offsets are UTF-16 throughout, matching `NSTextStorage`/`NSRange`, so emoji
  and other multibyte text need no conversion layer (covered by tests).
- Release perf on a 1 MB document: full parse 12.5 ms, **0.064 ms mean /
  0.088 ms p95 per edit** (debug: 2.8 ms mean, still inside the 5 ms gate).
  Both are asserted by tests in `Tests/FilawayCoreTests`.
- The highlighter is not a CommonMark parser and does not try to be: setext
  headings, reference links, HTML blocks and indented (4-space) code blocks are
  not styled. `swift-markdown` remains the source of truth for structure
  (chunking, code extraction) per plan §1.

## ADR-006 — Semantic search ships a bundled Core ML bge-small; NaturalLanguage is not a real fallback

**Date:** 2026-08-22 · **Task:** M1-08 (spike, plan §5 risk #4) · **Status:** accepted

**Context.** Plan §1 chose local Core ML embeddings (Anthropic has no
embeddings API) with a bge-small ↔ MiniLM decision deferred to M3-07, and plan
§8 added `NLContextualEmbedding` to the fallback ladder because this machine has
no Xcode and therefore no `coremlcompiler`. None of it had been tried.
Full measurements: `docs/spikes/embedder.md`.

**Decision.**

1. **Ship `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`** converted with `coremltools` to a fixed
   `[1, 256]` fp16 ML Program with CLS pooling and L2 normalisation baked into
   the graph (63.5 MB; 57.9 MB compressed). `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (43 MB, ~1.5×
   faster) stays converted and benchmarked as a one-line swap for M3-07.
2. **Ship the `.mlpackage`, not a `.mlmodelc`**, and compile it at first launch
   with `MLModel.compileModel(at:)` into Application Support. Measured cost:
   47–86 ms, once. Plan §8's workaround has no downside — adopt it permanently,
   not just until Xcode is installed.
3. **Batch 1, not batch 8.** Core ML pipelines an `MLArrayBatchProvider` over a
   batch-1 package as well as a batch-8 package does (4.06 vs 4.95 ms per
   embedding) without the 10× penalty on single-query latency.
4. **Demote the NaturalLanguage embedders.** `NLContextualEmbedding`
   (mean-pooled) and `NLEmbedding.sentenceEmbedding` answered 4/20 spike queries
   at rank 1, against 20/20 for both Core ML models and 16/20 for a plain BM25
   baseline. They stay implemented behind `Embedder`, but the real degradation
   path is **keyword-only FTS5 + Claude rerank**, which is measurably better
   than either.
5. **Pin the conversion toolchain** (`coremltools==9.0`, `torch==2.7.0`,
   `transformers==4.56.2`, Python 3.11) and **gate every conversion on a
   torch↔Core ML cosine ≥0.999**.

**Consequences.**
- Bundle grows by ~64 MB (plan §1 budgeted 35–65 MB); installs also spend ~64 MB
  in Application Support for the compiled model. Palettization (8-bit ≈ 33 MB)
  is the lever if that becomes a release blocker, gated on an M3-07 re-run.
- `fp16 + transformers' -3.4e38 attention mask = NaN`, silently and
  shape-dependently (every time at seq 64, never at seq 256). `convert.py` now
  overrides the mask with -1e4; the parity check is what caught it, so
  `--skip-golden` must not be used for anything shippable.
- Fixed sequence length makes short and long inputs cost the same, so **chunk
  size is a throughput decision**: M3-02 should target 180–250 tokens using
  `CoreMLEmbedder.tokenCount(_:)`, and a seq-64 bucket is available at 2× the
  throughput if short chunks dominate.
- Intel remains unmeasured on real hardware (no Intel Mac, and universal builds
  need Xcode). CPU-only on the M2 costs bge-small 6.6× on single embeddings and
  1.8× batched, while MiniLM costs only 1.3× — if Intel first-run indexing is
  too slow, the answer is MiniLM on Intel. M3-09/M4-07 must re-measure.
- 20k notes × ~4 chunks ≈ 80k embeddings ≈ 5.4 min of one-time indexing on an
  M2, and 61 MB of Float16 vectors in memory — plan §1's brute-force Accelerate
  matrix holds; `sqlite-vec` stays a Phase-2 option.
- The spike corpus (40 notes / 20 queries) is directional only. The ≥90% top-1
  gate remains M3-07's job on a generated 5k/20k corpus.
